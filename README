Here you have the programs I wrote on my MSX2 computer around 1986.

There're some utilities, as a character and Sprite designer.

The most important are:
- Warhol, a paint program taking advantage of the copy part of image/paste with bit operations.
- SimModul, a paint program that explores the different symmetry operations, in a 4 modules painting. 
Both use a GUI I invented using sprites as interface icons, that could be useful for other projects.
